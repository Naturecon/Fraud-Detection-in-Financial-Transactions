#  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to detect fraudulent financial transactions. Fraud detection is a critical problem for banks, fintech, and payment providers, as billions are lost annually due to fraudulent activity.

We will apply supervised machine learning techniques to identify suspicious transactions using labeled datasets.

# Goals

Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).

Measure performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Identify which features contribute most to fraud detection.

# Non-Goals

Real-time production deployment.

Integration with live banking/payment systems.

Development of a commercial product.

# Repository Structure


Data Source

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# Project Timeline

Week 1: Setup tools (Asana, GitHub, Tracker)

Week 2: Define scope & finalize Design Document

Week 3–4: Data preprocessing And EDA

Week 5–6: Train baseline & advanced ML models

Week 7: Model evaluation, comparison, Finalize report And presentation

# Project Overview
This repository contains the full implementation for **AAI-540 Final Project – Team 4 (Naturecon)**.  
The project develops a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, featuring:

- Clean, reproducible notebooks (`.ipynb`) aligned with the ML Design Document.  
- Data stored and versioned in AWS S3.  
- Models trained and evaluated in AWS SageMaker.  
- End-to-end workflow: data ingestion → EDA → training → evaluation → deployment simulation.  
- Both Logistic Regression and XGBoost models optimized for high recall and explainability.
