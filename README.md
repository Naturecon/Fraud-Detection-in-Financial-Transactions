#  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to detect fraudulent financial transactions. Fraud detection is a critical problem for banks, fintech, and payment providers, as billions are lost annually due to fraudulent activity.

We will apply supervised machine learning techniques to identify suspicious transactions using labeled datasets.

# Goals

Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).

Measure performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Identify which features contribute most to fraud detection.

# Non-Goals

Real-time production deployment.

Integration with live banking/payment systems.

Development of a commercial product.

# Repository Structure


Data Source

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
